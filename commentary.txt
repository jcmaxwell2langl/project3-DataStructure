Graph Implementation
I implement my graph with adjacency list. I chose this data structures
because it can manipulate the size of memory at ease.

Computational Complexity(insertVertex): O(1)
Computational Complexity(insertEdge): O(V)
Computational Complexity(isEdge): O(V)
Computational Complexity(getWeight): O(V)
Computational Complexity(getAdjacent): O(V)
Computational complexity(Dijkstra's algorithm): O(V^2), where V is the number
of vertices in the graph. 

Dijkstra Algorithm(more to it)
I use 2 arrays to implement the algorithm. The arrays represents the distance
and prior nodes of each vertex. The visited node is stored at a set data structure. 
To print the path of each vertex, I use a recursive method to do it.
